        <p class="doggy">Bridges are so cool I love crossing them they are so pretty.bridge,
             structure that spans horizontally between supports, whose function
              is to carry vertical loads. The prototypical bridge is quite simple—two
               supports holding up a beam—yet the engineering problems that must be overcome
                even in this simple form are inherent in every bridge: the supports must be 
                strong enough to hold the structure up, and the span between supports must
                 be strong enough to carry the loads. Spans are generally made as short as
                  possible; long spans are justified where good foundations are limited—for
                   example, over estuaries with deep water.All major bridges are built with the public’s money. Therefore, bridge design that best
             serves the public interest has a threefold goal: to be as efficient, as economical, and
              as elegant as is safely possible. Efficiency is a scientific principle that puts a value
               on reducing materials while increasing performance. Economy is a social principle that 
               puts value on reducing the costs of construction and maintenance while retaining efficiency.
                Finally, elegance is a symbolic or visual principle that puts value on the personal expression
                 of the designer without compromising performance or economy. There is little disagreement
                  over what constitutes efficiency and economy, but the definition of elegance has always 
                  been controversial. </p>

   <b>Details</b> What is Lorem Ipsum?
    Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</body>
