<h1 class="tikka">Tikka Masala</h1>
<p1 class="boobs">Directions
    For the chicken marinade: Whisk together the yogurt, ginger, salt, chili powder, <br>
    garam masala, pepper, turmeric and garlic in a large bowl until combined. Toss <br>
    the chicken in the spiced yogurt marinade until evenly coated. Wrap tightly with <br>
    plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 3 hours and up to 24. (Overnight works best.)<br>
    For the sauce: Melt the ghee in a large Dutch oven or wide heavy pot over medium<br>
    heat. Add the onions and serrano, season with 1 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring <br>
    occasionally, until the onions are golden and beginning to caramelize, 8 to 10<br>
    minutes. Add the ginger and garlic and cook, stirring, until very fragrant and<br>
    the ginger starts to turn golden and sticks to the bottom of the pot, 2 to 3<br>
    minutes. Add the fenugreek leaves, garam masala, chili powder and paprika and<br>
    cook, stirring occasionally, until very fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the<br>
    tomatoes, breaking them up into pieces with a spoon, and bring to a boil.<br>
    Reduce the heat and simmer uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the sauce <br>
    has reduced by half and the tomatoes are very tender, about 30 minutes.  <br>
    Let the hot sauce cool for about 5 minutes or so, then transfer it to a blend<br>er 
    filling no more than halfway. (If your blender is small, you may need to work <br>
    in batches.) Remove the center cap from the lid and place it on the blender.<br>
     Cover the lid with a kitchen towel to catch splatters, and pulse until smooth.<br>
      Add 1/4 cup heavy cream and puree until creamy. Pour into a clean pot and<br>
    bring to a simmer. Season with salt.    <br>
    Meanwhile, position a rack directly under the broiler and preheat to high.<br>
    Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil and set a wire rack inside.  <br>
    Arrange the chicken in a single layer on the rack. Broil until the chicken starts<br>
    to brown in spots, 3 to 6 minutes per side (it will not be cooked through). Remove <br>
    from the broiler. When cool enough to handle, cut the chicken into 1-inch pieces. <br>
    Add the chicken to the simmering sauce, cover and cook until the chicken is cooked<br>
     through, 8 to 10 minutes. <br>
    Top the chicken and sauce with cilantro. Serve with rice and naan.<br> 
    Cook’s Note :<br>
    Kashmiri red chili powder is mildly spicy with a bright red color. Look for it in <br>
    Indian and Asian markets. Ghee is clarified butter used in Indian cooking. It's <br>
    available in Asian markets and specialty grocery stores. We use fenugreek leaves <br>
    for their nutty and slightly minty flavor. If you can't find them, substitute dried<br>
     mint leaves and a pinch of ground fenugreek.<br></p1>

     <h1 class="penne">Penne Pasta</h1>
     <p1 class="boobs1">
        Steps to Make It
In a large skillet or saute pan, heat oil over medium heat. Add the onion and cook, frequently stirring, until softened. Stir in shredded carrot, chopped celery, and 1/4 cup water; cook until vegetables are tender and liquid has evaporated, about 5 minutes longer.

Add the ground beef to the vegetables and cook ​until it has browned and is no longer pink, or about 4 minutes. Add garlic and cook for 1 minute longer, stirring constantly.

Add the wine and cook until the liquid has evaporated about 5 minutes.

Stir in the flour and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes. Add the tomato paste, 1/2 cup of milk, salt, pepper, and oregano. Reduce heat and simmer, frequently stirring, until the milk has been absorbed.

Continue cooking until the sauce has thickened, gradually adding the remaining 1 cup of milk. Cook over low heat for about 15 to 20 minutes longer.

Meanwhile, cook penne pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water following the package directions until just tender; drain well.

Transfer sauce to a large serving bowl. Add the penne pasta and Parmesan cheese; toss penne pasta gently. Sprinkle some extra Parmesan cheese over the bowl of pasta and serve more at the table.

    <div>
        
        <p class="doggy">Bridges are so cool I love crossing them they are so pretty.bridge,
             structure that spans horizontally between supports, whose function
              is to carry vertical loads. The prototypical bridge is quite simple—two
               supports holding up a beam—yet the engineering problems that must be overcome
                even in this simple form are inherent in every bridge: the supports must be 
                strong enough to hold the structure up, and the span between supports must
                 be strong enough to carry the loads. Spans are generally made as short as
                  possible; long spans are justified where good foundations are limited—for
                   example, over estuaries with deep water.All major bridges are built with the public’s money. Therefore, bridge design that best
             serves the public interest has a threefold goal: to be as efficient, as economical, and
              as elegant as is safely possible. Efficiency is a scientific principle that puts a value
               on reducing materials while increasing performance. Economy is a social principle that 
               puts value on reducing the costs of construction and maintenance while retaining efficiency.
                Finally, elegance is a symbolic or visual principle that puts value on the personal expression
                 of the designer without compromising performance or economy. There is little disagreement
                  over what constitutes efficiency and economy, but the definition of elegance has always 
                  been controversial. </p>

   <b>Details</b> What is Lorem Ipsum?
    Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</body>
